Developing a model to predict daily stock trends by fusing OHLCV financial data with sentiment features extracted from financial news and a dynamic pipeline using GNews and yfinance, passing news data through a frozen Emtract model to generate 7-category emotion labels. Applying contrastive learning to align these emotional embeddings with historical price patterns, creating discriminative encoders trained on an 80/20 split and designed to generalise on a separate, live test dataset.
